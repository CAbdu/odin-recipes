<p>This kebab sandwich is my version of Turkish kebabs, which I made 'off the cuff' after searching unsuccessfully for a recipe online.<br> The original sandwiches are made from meat pressed into a loaf and grilled on a rotating spit.<br> The meat is shaved off as it gets crispy and put into a pita sandwich.</p>
   <ul><h3>ingredients</h3>
    <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Â½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>6 pita bread rounds</li>
  </ul>
  <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
    <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
      <p>Make marinade: Place onions in a large ceramic bowl and crush with the bottom of a glass until juice is rendered and onions look translucent.<br> Stir in garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, black pepper, turmeric, curry powder, and salt.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
      <p>Make sauce: Combine sour cream, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, dill, and garlic in a medium bowl; mix until well combined.<br> Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
